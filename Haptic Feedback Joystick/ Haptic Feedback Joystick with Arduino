# Haptic Feedback Joystick with Arduino [Click Here](https://makersportal.com/blog/haptic-feedback-joystick-with-arduino).
Haptic technology facilitates investigation of how the human sense of touch works by allowing the creation of controlled haptic virtual objects.In the human hand the submodalities of touch are sensed by four types of mechanoreceptors. Specific tactile sensations occur when distinct types of receptors are activated. Firing of all four receptors produces the sensation of contact with an object. Selective activation of Merkel cells and Ruffini endings produces sensations of steady pressure on the skin above the receptor. When the same patterns of firing occur only in Meissner's and Pacinian corpuscles, the tingling sensation of vibration is perceived.

## Summary of the project
A vibration motor and joystick were used to create a haptic feedback device using the Arduino platform. As a response to specific changes in joystick position, prescribed vibration motor actions corresponding to the movement of the joystick.

This allowed us to create haptic vibration feedback similar to those used in video games and virtual reality systems. The goal of this tutorial was to introduce users to haptic technology that can immerse users into the digital world using physical feedback mechanisms, such as vibration.

Different tunings of the vibration motor can provide users with instructions based on their input, which makes this type of application useful for enhancing digital media, as referenced above, or situations such as visually impaired navigation, feedback in auditory-restricted environments, and delivering quiet notifications to users. Haptics can be incredibly useful in emulating the real world and immersing users into scenarios that may otherwise be dangerous or difficult to experience. Vibrational haptic feedback is just one of a series of haptic mechanisms, and this tutorial was just a simple entry into a wide ranging and evolving field of human computer interaction.
