# Drawing Plotter debugging
## 1)	Misalignment of the structure: 
This sounds a simple to fix error but it can cause huge changes in the writing of the drawings and even damaging the motors as well. 
This can be fixed by using 90-degree angle and bubble indicator to check the perpendicular and parallelism error.


## 2)	Motor driver connections: In order to check the functioning of motor driver we have to go step by step:
1)	Line power
2)	Proper connection of motor
3)	Make sure the motor is receiving a signal
4)	Control signal
5)	Trim pot adjustments
6)	Input Voltage Selector Switches


## 3)	Problem of assembling 3D printed parts: 
It is very essential to have allowance and tolerance to be taken care while designing. Also, when the ink of 3D printer cools down, shrinkage also should be taken care. 

## 4)	Servo motor holding the pencil or pen: 
If you find it is difficult to hold or press, we can attach spring of appropriate stiffness.


## 15)	G codes:
There are two modes of operation of G codes incremental an absolute. Both have their applications but mostly absolute is used. There are open-source softwareâ€™s used to visualise the travel of the tool (Pencil) so before drawing anything we can check beforehand.
