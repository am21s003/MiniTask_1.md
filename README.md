For this reason, specialist machinery is used to ensure accuracy, quality and performance. To help you understand more about the process. Most of the PCB drilling machines are costly but in this project they have made it very cheap and also some upgradation of conventional machines.

## Summary of Project

The foot pedal allows us to position the work with both hands and double check the alignment before I drill. We can position the work with our thumbs and then pull the drill down with our index fingers. They have found this method to be both quick and accurate, but you may want to rig up some sort of a handle.
The drill is powered from my bench supply. This gives us variable speed and saves me the cost of building a dedicated power source for the drill. The constant current source for the light maintains the illumination level regardless of the motor speed. The foot pedal raised the drill motor. This made accurate drilling fast and easy, and didn't require dots in the centre of pads, and the corresponding issue of slight misalignment of top and bottom pad dots.
