# THIRD EYE FOR THE BLIND - an Innovative Wearable Technology for Blinds
## Problem Statement: 
Creating five modules of ultrasonic sensor and vibration actuator along with the beeper and mounting them on to elastic bands 


## Ideation and Planning: 
wearable device based on the Arduino board which can be worn like a cloth for blinds.

This device is equipped with five ultrasonic sensors, consisting of five modules which are connected to the different parts of the body.

Among them, two for both shoulders, another two for both knees and one for the hand. Using the five ultrasonic sensors, blind can detect the objects in a five-dimensional view around them and can easily travel anywhere.

The intensity of vibration and rate of beeping increases with decrease in distance and this is a fully automated device.

## Prototyping phase:
### Following components to be connected as shown in the circuit diagram.
1.	5 x Arduino pro mini
2.	5 x Ultrasonic sensor
3.	5 x Perfboard
4.	5 x Vibrating motor
5.	5 x Buzzers
6.	5 x Red LEDs
7.	5 x Switches
8.	Male and female header pins
9.	4 x Jumper cable
10.	One power bank
11.	One 3.3-volt old mobile battery
12.	Some elastics and stickers (to make it as a band for wearing)



We can give provision of selecting the mode of actuation to user i.e.,
1) Only vibration
2) Only Beep sounds
3) Both



5.	First cut the pref board in 5 X 3 cm dimension and solder the female headers for the Arduino to the board.
6.	Then solder the buzzer.
7.	Then connect the vibrating motor using the glue gun and solder wires to it.
8.	Then connect the LED.
9.	Then connect the switch.
10.	Then connect header pins for ultrasonic sensors and for battery input.
11.	Then solder everything as shown in the circuit diagram.
12.	Now connect the Arduino and ultrasonic sensor to the board
13.	Also connect the elastic band to all the modules.
14.	Connect the ultrasonic sensor to the board by using 4 jumper cables.
15.	Then connect a 3.7-volt mobile battery to this module.
16.	Then connect the elastic band as shown in the figure.
17.	At last upload the code to each Arduino board and power the 4 other modules using a power bank.


**The entire project can be made in the form of jacket, so that the device doesn't need to be wear one by one.**
