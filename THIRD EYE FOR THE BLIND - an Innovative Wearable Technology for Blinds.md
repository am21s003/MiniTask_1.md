# THIRD EYE FOR THE BLIND - an Innovative Wearable Technology for Blinds
Third eye for blinds is an innovation which helps the blinds people to navigate with speed and confidence by detecting the nearby obstacles using the help of ultrasonic waves and notify them with buzzer sound or vibration. They only need to wear this device as a band or cloth.

## Introduction
By wearing this device, they can fully avoid the use of white cane and such other devices. This device will help the blind to navigate without holding a stick which is a bit annoying for them. They can simply wear it as a band or cloth and it can function very accurately and they only need a very little training to use it.

## Components used:
1.	5 x Arduino pro mini
2.	5 x Ultrasonic sensor
3.	5 x Preboard
4.	5 x Vibrating motor
